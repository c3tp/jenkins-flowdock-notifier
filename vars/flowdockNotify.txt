A simple Groovy function which enables Flowdock notifications to be sent from a Jenkins Pipeline.

You must declare use of the library somewhere before use:

```library 'flowdock-notifier'```

Then, call `flowdockNotify` in an appropriate place in your pipeline.  It needs to be a _step_-class block, including and probably most appropriately a _post_ block.  There are three arguments:

1. `this` - passes the script object to the notifier function to provide necessary context
2. `type` - tells the script if you want a flow message or inbox message. Only accepts string `message` or `inbox`
2. A sources API Flow Token.
3. A string containing list of tags (optional).

For example:

```
library 'flowdock-notifier'

pipeline {
    // ...
    post { 
        changed { 
            flowdockNotify this, 'type', 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX', '#test'
        }
    }
}
```

In order to get a flow_token to a source, you will need to create an application.
