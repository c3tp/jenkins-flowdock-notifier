A simple Groovy function which enables Flowdock notifications to be sent from a Jenkins Pipeline.

You must declare use of the library somewhere before use:

```library 'flowdock-notifier'```

Then, call `flowdockNotify` in an appropriate place in your pipeline.  It needs to be a _step_-class block, including and probably most appropriately a _post_ block.  There are three arguments:

1. `this` - passes the script object to the notifier function to provide necessary context
2. API token for Flowdock.  This can be retrieved from your Flowdock profile page
3. A string containing list of tags (optional).

For example:

```
library 'flowdock-notifier'

pipeline {
    // ...
    post { 
        changed { 
            flowdockNotify this,'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX', '#test'
        }
    }
}
```
